- Create a Monitoring Dashboard for an Application
	- Metrics dashboards allow teams to monitor the whole application in real-time, crucial for handling downtime or application service disruption. DevOps dashboards combine information from various monitoring technologies to build monitoring reports for development and operations teams. They also enable teams to keep track of different KPIs, including service deployment delays, bugs, problems, work items, backlogs, etc. You can develop DevOps platform observation dashboards on Prometheus or Grafana for practice.
- Automate Kubernetes Cluster Deployment With Terraform
	- Getting a Kubernetes cluster up and running hasn't always been easy, much alone one suitable for production. While few may want to build a Kubernetes cluster from scratch, most of us seek quick and automated solutions. Under this domain, there have been a (significant) number of vendor and Kubernetes community initiatives, many of which are still in development.

The Terraform Kubernetes Installer is a Terraform template for quickly deploying a Kubernetes cluster on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). You can now combine Kubernetes' production-grade container orchestration with this project's management, security, and predictability.

You learned about the 15 DevOps Project Ideas for Practice in this article. These projects can help you build your resume while applying for job interviews. We went through some of the most popular DevOps tools and applications for developing superior applications. Working on these projects will help you understand how to implement DevOps concepts. 
- Java Application using Gradle
	- Gradle is a well-known build automation tool that works across a variety of platforms and languages. This project includes establishing a Java application and breaking it down into subprojects in order to modularize it.

After completing this project, you will know how to initialize a project as Java application, run the build and build itâ€™s test report. You will learn the way to execute a Java application and build it in an archive. [guide here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/samples/sample_building_java_applications.html)
